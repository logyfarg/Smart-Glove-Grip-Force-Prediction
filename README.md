## 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Glove-Grip-Force-Prediction.git
cd Smart-Glove-Grip-Force-Prediction
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the notebook or script:
jupyter notebook grip_force_prediction.ipynb
📊 Model Details
Model: Random Forest Regressor

Metric: R² Score

Goal: Predict the grip force applied based on 24 sensor readings.

📈 Results
The model achieved reasonable predictive performance, visualized with scatter plots comparing actual vs. predicted grip force.
💡 Future Work
Try other regression algorithms (XGBoost, Neural Networks).

Hyperparameter tuning.

Real-time prediction pipeline.
